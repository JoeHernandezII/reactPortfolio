                    <p>I am a University of Kansas graduate currently finishing up their Full Stack Development camp.  I hoping to either further my career getting into web development and possibly do some free lance work helping others achieve their webpage goals.</p>
                    <p>Before COVID-19, I'd enjoy venturing out and about with my family taking in sites and having them try all the different delicaies that the Kansas City area has to offer.</p>
                    <p>Be sure to look at my resume and projects I've been working on up above!</p>
